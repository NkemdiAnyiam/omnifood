# omnifood
Omnifood is a nonexistent food delivery service, and I created this page during Jonas Schmedtmann's course "Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3".
View the site here: https://nkemdianyiam.github.io/omnifood/. Any button that's supposed to take you to another page does not actually function.
